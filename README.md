# Results
Although it was not specified in the task, I decided to implement a separate backend on Rails 5 and frontend on React(it should be helpful for me, because I had no experience in creating React apps from scratch, only worked with existent ones). At the moment, the backend is ready. If it meets your expectations, I will proceed to the implementation of the client side.

# NOTES
* I havn't used devise for authorization, b/c of wanna play w/ JWT
* logout is not needed - just to delete token on front end should be enough
* token expiration have not implemented yet
* cart haven't got pagination yet
* registration email-confirmation functionality have not implemented yet
* API versioning have not implemented yet
